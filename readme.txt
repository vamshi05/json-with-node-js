Hello Guys,

1. Start your node server "node app.js"
2. Use REST client, Postman and do the following:

POST: use id,date,weight as keys
PUT: use id,date and new weight
GET: use id, date to get weight and also the average weight of that user
DELETE: remove records based on id and date

Refer console and Client for output
